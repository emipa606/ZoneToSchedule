If there is an area that matches a pawns current schedule-type they will automatically be confined to that area.
For example, if you define an area with the name "Work" then any time a pawns schedule is set to Work, their allowed area will be changed to the Work-area.

Drafted or uncontrollable pawns will not change their area. 
If a pawns area is changed manually it will remain until the next schedule-type.
At the start of the next schedule item, if there is no matching area, it will try to set it back to the area used before automatic change. If that area does not exist, it will set unrestricted instead.

If you want to have custom schedules per pawn the user Messianic Gaming made an expanded version of this mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717694491]Custom Schedules[/url]
